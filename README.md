## PokeCompanion

- Welcome to the PokeCompanion ReadMe!!!!

- This app is a companion app for any main series Pokemon video game.
- It allows users to track their Pokemon's growth throughout their playthough so that they can see the strengths and weaknesses it develops, keep track of their stats as well as predict how they will continue to grow. The app will assist the user throughout their playthough by offering bits of advice concerning how to raise their Pokemon, as well as providing an easy way to theorycraft and plan their perfect team for their game.

## External requirements

- The app is being developed for android. There is not currently a testable build of the app yet.

## Setup

- There is not currently a testable build of the app available.

## Running

- There is not currently a testable build of the app available.

## Deployment

## Testing

The current working test for the method weightedAverage is located in /app/src/androidTest/Java/com/example/template and is called ExampleInstrumentedTest.
It can be ran by right clicking on the method and clicking run. The build will compile and the terminal will say "Test Ran Successfully" after it has completed.

Unfortunately, we built our behavioral test in Firebase, and from working on it learned that we must pay to actually test the code. We intend to potentially change our method of behavioral testing.
